# Car Emissions

### PRE-REQUISITE


Humans have caused a lot of harm to the world over time by manufacturing pollution in numerous forms such as air, sound, water, soil, and so on. Here, we shall focus on the air pollution created by IC engines. Air pollution is described as "the presence of one or more pollutants in sufficient quantities in the earth's atmosphere to produce short- or long-term detrimental impacts to human, animal, plant, and environmental life." Since their inception, automobiles have contributed to environmental degradation by generating air pollution.

The goal of this article is to gather and analyse current trends in the car sector, as well as to deploy an emissions forecast model, using Multivariate Linear Regression. A brief survey of automobiles owned by people was conducted to determine the type of engine utilised, such as gasoline or diesel, engine size, which BS regulations these cars come under, the quantity of pollution they release, and so on.

We see a drastic change in emissions caused by different fuels. Here we are comparing the emissions caused by Diesel, Gasoline, Ethanol and Premium Gasoline. Even in these four fuels there is a reduction in the pollutants emitted at the cost reduction in engine efficiencies. For instance emissions caused by diesel are CO(0.50g/km), NOx(0.25g/km ), HC + NOx together (0.30g/km) whereas gasoline emits CO(1g/km), HC(0.10g/km), NOx(0.08g/km). The ethanol fuel or E85 compared to gasoline emits CO at a reduced by 38%, NOx reduced by around 59% and HC is reduced by around 8% (the CO emissions are more during the winters). These emissions by Premium Gasoline are CO(2.56ppm), HC(0.68ppm), NOx(0.01ppm).
